# Shooter-2D
Basic 2D shooter made using the Godot engine. After following an online tutorial and making a game called "Dodge the creeps" this was my first original project 
on the Godot Engine. Before this project I had my doubts regarding the concept of signals in Godot but after completing this project on my own I not only got 
familiar with the in-built signals in Godot, but also created my own signals and emmitted them. The important differences in different types of Nodes also 
became clear to me after completion of this project.
